# What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses

## Project Description

An essential part of every business is planning for the future and ensuring that it survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, I explore data from [BusinessFinancing.co.uk](https://businessfinancing.co.uk/) on the world's oldest businesses.

The data is contained in several different datasets/tables. I first used joining techniques to merge the data, followed by manipulation techniques which enabled me to answer questions about the world's oldest businesses, such as when they were founded and which industries they belong to.

I completed two projects using the same data: one in **Python** using various manipulation techniques in **pandas**, and another in **SQL** using **PostgreSQL**.

## 1. Python project

### Techniques used:

- Importing data
- Joining data
- Sorting
- Filtering
- Subsetting

- Which industry has the oldest businesses?
- Which restaurants have been around since before the year 1800?
- Looking at an industry level, when was every continent's oldest business founded?

## 2. SQL project

### Techniques used:

- Joining tables
- Aggregating
- Filtering
- Ordering data

### Questions answered:

- When was the oldest business in the world founded?
- How many businesses were founded before 1000, and which are they?
- What industries constitute the oldest companies worldwide, and which industries are most common?
- Which are the oldest businesses on every continent, and when were they founded?
